##Computational Form: Spring 2016

Computer programming is a powerful tool for creating and manipulating form and has long been used to by artists, designers, and composers to explore new aesthetics. Under the direction of Justin Bakse, my classmates and I continued this tradition of experimentation by creating posters, music, animation, video, and 3D forms completely from code.  Topics included: scripting Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, audio synthesis in Javascript/p5, and using OpenSCAD to create models for 3D printing.

In short, we learned to make things that make things.
